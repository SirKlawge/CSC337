SYNOPSIS: The Barbie movie presents a hilariously accurate hellscape of bourgois capitalism but with the tradional patriarchal power structures flipped, leaving Ken to only self-actualize via his oppressor.  However, a journey to the real world exposes the characters to True and Revolutionary ideas that change the master-slave dynamic of the Barbie world.  This movie reinforces the correct morality- the Party's morality.
